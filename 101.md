# Java 101 - The Basics

## What is Java?

* General purpose programming language
* Object-oriented
* Class-based
* "Write once, run anywhere"
    * Compiled to bytecode, runs on a Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
* Automatic memory management

## The origins of Java and it's meaning today

* Designed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (acquired by Oracle)
* JDK 1.0 was released on January 23, 1996 (Beta in 1995)
* "Oak"
* Java Applets
* Today
    * most popular programming language together with C
    * currently Java 8 (6 + 7 still widely used)
    * Android

# Classes

* Object-oriented programming
* class
* Single inheritance
* extends

```
public class Fruit {
}
```

```
public class Apple extends Fruit {
}
```

```
Fruit fruit = new Apple();
```

# Visibility

* Access level modifiers
    * public
    * private
    * protected
    * package
* Only one public class per file

# Interfaces

* implements
* One class can implement multiple interfaces

# Comments

```
// single line comment
```

```
/*
  block comment 
 */
```

# Datatypes

* Primitives
    * int, long, float, double
    * boolean
        * true
        * false
    * char
    * int[], float[]
    
* Classes
    * Integer, Long, Float, Double
    * Boolean
        * Boolean.TRUE
        * Boolean.FALSE
    * String
    * Array

# Variables and operators

```
int i = 0;
```

```
i = 1;
```

```
i++;
i = i + 1;
```

# Expressions, statements, blocks

# Flow control

```
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  // ...
}
```

```
boolean condition = true;
do {
  // ...
} while(condition);
```




# Exceptions

* Error, Exception (checked), RuntimeException (unchecked)
* throws
* try, catch, (finally)

```
try {
  // some exception could occur
} catch(Exception e) {
  // handle the exception
}
```

```
public class MyException extends Exception {
  // ...
}
```
